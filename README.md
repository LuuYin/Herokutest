# 2AFC-triplet-selection-ionic-app

This app is created using the ionic framework v3: https://ionicframework.com. You need to install this.

In `src/assets/data` you will need to add a list of image names calles `clusters.json`.

In `src/assets/img` you will need to add the corresponding images.

In `src/providers/data/data.ts` you will need to change line 59. Dump the result of the clicking somewhere. I had my local database for this but a simple json file will do. If you want I could create a new table in the database for you which you can access, let me know. 

now run: 
> `npm install`

> `ionic serve`

Let me know if you have questions
